# Stepper-Motor-Control-System

This project implements a precision fluid-dispensing system using a stepper motor controlled by an Arduino. The system is designed for low-volume appliations where accurate motion control is critical. A serial input interface enables user-specified commands, while built-in return-to-origin logic and error-handling routines ensure reliable and repeatable operation.
